## Official dark mode
Is now available, so you can use it instead. If you don't like it, you can use [the new light userstyle](https://github.com/a0eoc/UserCSS/tree/main/VK/Vdarker) I made because this 11k line CSS has became too hard to maintain.

Optional features such as ads hiding are separated to [CleanVK](https://github.com/a0eoc/UserCSS/tree/main/VK/Enhancements).
